 <h3> <p>Goodjob Barbie You Made The Right Decision!</h3> </p>
    <p> You have successfully defended yourself and made a run for it. You are now in the Dreamhouse mega kitchen and see a group of Barbies gathered there. </p>
    <p> They are all looking at you and check to see if you are infected. They then let you in on what happened, and what they plan to do. </p>
   <b> <p> They tell you that they need your help to save Barbieland. </p> </b>

   <hr>
    <p> You have two options: </p>
    <ol> <b>
        <li> <a href="page3.html"> Help the Barbies save Barbieland </li> </a>
        <li> <a href= "page7.html"> Leave Barbieland in your camper van without helping </li> </a>
