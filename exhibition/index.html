<p>The internet almost feels endless with so many different websites and content. The internet is not the only thing that feels endless, there are also websites that feel infinite. One link clicked leads to a new page, a new link, and new content. This often makes the website also feel endless.</p>
  This often occurs due to hyperlinking, allowing for the net artist to create more dynamic pieces of net art. 
  
<p>Hyperlinking for net art began in the 1990s with artists like Oila Lialina who created My Boyfriend Came Back from the War and used hyperlinks to create unique pieces of net art.</p>
  
  <p>Another way net art feels endless is when it is interactive and the user is able to interact with different features. JODI a group of two well-known early net artists who incorporated interactive features into their works.</p>
  
<p> By incorporating this theme of endlessness into their projects, I believe that these net artists aim to move away from conventional narratives, and conventional websites. Conventional narratives are usually linear and websites that follow predictable storie, and are easy to navigate. Users follow a story with clear beginnings ad endings. In a typical website, when you click a button you know exactly where it will take you. However, In these net art projects the experience feels less predictable and each click leads the user to new content with further creating a sense of endlessness and exploration. </p>
  
<p> Some of these pieces of net art almost seem to tell a story such as Mouchette and My Boyfriend Came Back from the War. However, these pieces of art immerse the user into the story more. I also feel as if the net art projects that incorporate a sense of infinity/endlesses mimic the internet which often feels the same.</p>
  
</p>For this Net Art Exhibition, each of the pieces chosen are interactive and some have hyperlinks. All of them feel as if they are endless, with so many different pages, and content. </p> <br>

<p><b><h3>Title: Because Recollection</h3></b></p>

<p><b>Description:</b> Because Recollection is an interactive website that takes users on a journey through ten years of music. There are many different interactive features and music and many different songs. The user simply holds down on their space bar and is taken to a new artist/song. It feels endless because of how many songs there are and how many features.

<p><b>Description:</b> Mouchette is a piece that revolves around a young girl who is interested in suicide. This net art tells a story in an interactive manner.

<p><b><h3>Title: %Location wwwwwwwww </h3></b></p>
<p><h3>By: JODI (Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans)</h3></p>
<p><h4></b>Year:</b> 1995</h4></p>
<p><b>Description:</b> wwwwwwwww.jodi.org is a glitchy and chaotic net art website created by JODI. It features a seemingly broken page and is much different than a traditional website. There are also different elements present on the screen that the user can click to be taken to another page of the website, that is also glitchy and chaotic. The website seems confusing and as if it isnâ€™t functioning as intended, but that is exactly what the user is supposed to see.
