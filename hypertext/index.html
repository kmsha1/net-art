 <h1> <p>Hey Barbie, Survive Zombie Barbieland</p> </h1>
  <p>Barbie, you have just woken up and are hearing strange noises. You are currently in the Dreamhouse and look outside. Turns out Barbieland has become Zombieland, infested by zombie Kens... 
<p> <i> <b> You must figure out how to cure the Kens and save BarbieLand. </b> </i> </p>
 <p> </p> 
 <p> You have decided to investigate the source of this strange noise. You follow it to your HUGE closet and see <b>ZOMBIE KEN </b> about to rip up your favorite pink dress.</p> 
   
 <hr>
 <p> You have two options: </p>
    <ol> <b>
      <li> <a href= "page2.html"> Defend yourself, Grab the nearest stiletto and attack the zombie Ken and then make a run for it  </a>
        <hr> </li> </a>
        <li> <a href="page6.html"> Risk getting bit and save the dress </li> </a>
    </b>
    </ol>
